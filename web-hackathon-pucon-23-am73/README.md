# Dynamic Event Scheduler

## Introduction
The "Dynamic Event Scheduler" is a web application designed to provide users with a convenient platform for creating, managing, and scheduling events dynamically. This application aims to simplify the process of organizing and participating in various events, enhancing user engagement and experience.

## Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced world, event organization and management can be a complex and time-consuming task. Traditional methods of event scheduling often involve manual coordination, communication, and tracking, which can lead to inefficiencies, confusion, and missed opportunities. There is a need for a reliable and user-friendly web application that streamlines the event management process, allowing users to easily create, manage, and participate in events of their interest.

The challenge is to develop a web application that allows users to register, create, manage, and participate in events seamlessly. The application should offer features such as event creation, search and filtering, event participation, notifications and reminders, an event feed, a wishlist or favorite feature, and a user-friendly interface. Additionally, the platform should allow users to save events they are interested in, creating a wishlist or favorite list for easy access. It should leverage modern web development technologies and prioritize security, performance, and scalability.

## Features
1. User Registration and Authentication:
   - Secure registration and login functionality for users to access the application.

2. Event Creation and Management:
   - Create new events with essential details like title, description, date, time, poster, and duration.
   - Support for both one-time and recurring event schedules.
   - Edit and delete events as needed.
   - User-friendly interface for efficient event management.

3. Event Search and Filtering:
   - Search events based on keywords (title, description) or date.
   - Implement filters to refine event searches using categories or tags.
   - Visually appealing display of search results.

4. Event Participation:
   - Enable users to join events with a "Join" button.
   - Limit the number of participants for each event.
   - Display a participant list with status (confirmed, pending).

5. Notifications and Reminders:
   - Notification system for upcoming events, changes, and cancellations.
   - Reminders via email or push notifications based on user preferences.
   - Timely notifications with relevant event details.
   - Notify users when an event is created related to their interest tags.

6. Event Feed:
   - View a feed of events created by other users.
   - Display event details, including name, date, time, duration, poster, and type.
   - Filter events based on preferences and interests.
   - Sort events by popularity, date, or proximity.

7. Wishlist or Favorite Feature:
   - Allow users to save events to their wishlist or favorite list.
   - Easy access to the saved events for future reference.
   - Option to remove events from the wishlist or favorite list.

8. User Experience:
   - Intuitive and responsive user interface with an appealing design.
   - Validation and error handling for user inputs.
   - Performance optimization for a large number of concurrent users.
   - Compatibility across web browsers and devices.

9. Additional Considerations:
   - Use modern web development technologies and frameworks to build the application.
   - Ensure the application's security by handling potential vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
   - Pay attention to code quality, readability, and maintainability.
   - Write clear documentation on how to deploy and use the application.

## Evaluation Criteria
The submitted project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Completion of requirements (60%)
- Visual Design (15%)
- Case Study Analysis (10%)
- Design Approach (10%)
